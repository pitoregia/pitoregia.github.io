For my cv/portfolio, I aim to get a simple and minimalistic look without overkill features and content. Though, my CV is a bit plain because I put too little content in it.
But, I feel great because I did this 80% with my own work. At first, it's really hard, considering I'm still a beginner in this field.
My biggest distraction was when I found out what @media do. @media is a really nice feature because it makes my web a 'little' bit responsive, though it's not working correctly with my CV. But it's a fun way to learn coding HTML and CSS.
